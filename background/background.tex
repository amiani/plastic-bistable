\section*{Background}

The plastic bistable recurrent cells that I investigate in this report are a mixture of two concepts: Neuromodulated Bistable Recurrent Cells\cite{vecoven2021brc} and differentiable plasticity\cite{miconi2018diffplas}. Bistable recurrent cells are very similar in form to a commonly used model called the Gated Recurrent Unit\cite{cho2014gru}, which are in turn a type of recurrent neural network. This section explains the background behind each of these concepts.
