\section{Method}

While bistable recurrent cells have been shown to effectively hold on to memories unperturbed for long periods of time, these results have primarly been shown on inputs of relatively low dimension. By constrast, plastic neural networks are able to form very high-dimensional memories, but have not been shown to hold them over long time horizons.
The main innovation of this report is therefore a combination of the two into a Plastic Bistable Recurrent Cell model.
